SBA 320H - React Web Application Project

Requirements: 

Your application must meet these requirements to pass (this is your Minimum Viable Product):

- Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and REACT.
- Hosted on Netlify.
- Frequent commits to GitHub.
- A README.md file in your GitHub repository with:

    - Explanations of the technologies used.
    - Explanations of the approach taken.
        - Wrapped the app in BrowserRouter inside of the main.jsx file. This allows me to make routes for various pages such as Back Exercises and Chest Exercises. 
    - A link to your live site.
    - Usage instructions, if relevant.
    - Unsolved problems.

- Use AJAX to make a request to an external data source like OMDBapi, and insert some of the data retrieved into the DOM.
